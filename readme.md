# Intro

This is a project I wanted to build from a long time, also using best practices. Test driven development is kind of new to me, so to explore that and see how it helps improve the developer experience, this is my shot at it.

This project is mainly a reminder app that anyone can use to remind themselves about important events in their life. While you can just use a reminder app, I found that is not reliable. I often change phones, laptops etc. Hence a robust system that can remind you in whatever device you are using is really important. 

You can use this to remind yourself of a friends birthday, for example. Or you can use this to remind your self to kill an EC2 instance to save costs. Whatever.
