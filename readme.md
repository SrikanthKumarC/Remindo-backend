# Intro

This is a project I've been wanting to build for a long time, and I'm keen to use best practices throughout. Test-driven development is relatively new to me, so I see this as an opportunity to explore it and see how it can improve the development process.

The project is a reminder app designed to help people keep track of important events in their lives. While there are plenty of reminder apps out there, I've found them unreliable, especially since I frequently switch between phones, laptops, and other devices. I need a robust system that can send reminders regardless of which device I'm using at the time.

You could use this app to remind yourself of a friend's birthday or to remember to shut down an EC2 instance to save costs. Essentially, it's a versatile tool for any kind of reminder you might need.
